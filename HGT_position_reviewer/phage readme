All 23 non-rearranged GPA genones submitted to detection by PHASTER (http://phaster.ca) on 03.03.2019

Results parsed and plots derived for both "intact" only and all phage-associated genes. The latter will include some spurious annotations by name (e.g. "integrase"). The intact-only set is thus conservative.

See PHASTER website or summary.txt output files for details on detection approach and scoring.

Overall, phages do not associate with Vertical regions, as might be expected.
